                As a programmer, over the years, I have come across multiple languages and frameworks,
                including, but not limited to, Python, C, Java, JavaScript, MIPS, ReactJS and Django.
                A lot of my experience lies in Python and JavaScript and I am the most comfortable in
                these two languages. Through personal and course projects I have gained an interest in
                web development and would love to further this interest in a professional environment!
                <br></br>
                Additionally, I am also very interested in exploring the field of Artificial Intelligence, specially
                Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

                Besides Computer Science, I am also very passionate about Psychology.
                I am a big fan of Cognitive Psychology and love studying about abstract
                concepts such as thinking, decision making, percpetion and consciousness.
                I also enjoy reading up on how languages are processed in the brain and I would like
                expand this interest into CS and dabble in Natural Language Processing.
                <br></br>
                I believe that the fields of CS, specifically Artificial Intelligence,
                and Psychology overlap significantly. Therefore, I am currently trying to further my
                 understanding of the interaction between these two fields.
